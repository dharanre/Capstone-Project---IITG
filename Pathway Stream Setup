# We use Pathwayâ€™s demo module to replay the static CSV as a streaming source. Pathway allows streaming mode processing, treating each row as a real-time event
pathway.com
. We define a schema matching the CSV columns and start a streaming table from the CSV:


# src/simulation.py

import pathway as pw
from pricing_models import apply_pricing_models

class ParkingEvent(pw.Schema):
    """Schema for a parking lot event (one time step for one lot)."""
    SystemCodeNumber: str
    Capacity: int
    Latitude: float
    Longitude: float
    Occupancy: int
    VehicleTypeWeight: float
    TrafficLevelNum: float
    QueueLength: int
    IsSpecialDay: int
    Timestamp: float  # We use epoch float for simplicity

# Read the CSV with Pathway in streaming mode (using demo.replay_csv)
events = pw.demo.replay_csv(
    path='data/dataset.csv',
    schema=ParkingEvent,
    input_rate=1.0  # rows per second (adjust as needed)
)
