Dynamic Urban Parking Pricing Engine Summer Analytics 2025 - Final Submission Report

# ðŸš— Dynamic Urban Parking Pricing Engine

A real-time, data-driven pricing system for 14 urban parking lots using streaming data, economic principles, and machine learning models â€” built entirely using **Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Pathway**.

> ðŸ§  Developed as part of **Summer Analytics 2025**, hosted by the **Consulting & Analytics Club Ã— Pathway**.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Urban parking is limited and highly demanded. Static pricing causes either underutilization or overcrowding.  
This project aims to solve that using:

- Real-time dynamic pricing based on demand and competition
- Real-world features like traffic, queue, vehicle type, special events
- A multi-stage pricing model pipeline
