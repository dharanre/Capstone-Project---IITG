## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

Urban parking is limited and highly demanded. Static pricing causes either underutilization or overcrowding.  
This project aims to solve that using:

- Real-time dynamic pricing based on demand and competition
- Real-world features like traffic, queue, vehicle type, special events
- A multi-stage pricing model pipeline
